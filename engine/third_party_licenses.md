# Third-party code used by the engine

Nothing listed here is vendored into git. CMake fetches the SDKs at configure
time (`FetchContent`, see `engine/CMakeLists.txt`) into the build tree
(`engine/build*/_deps/`, or `target/dstudio-third-party/` for cargo builds),
both of which are git-ignored. Offline builds can point CMake at local
checkouts with `-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_DSTUDIO_CLAP=<dir>` and
`-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_DSTUDIO_VST3SDK=<dir>`.

Notes:

* Only the `pluginterfaces` and `public.sdk` submodules of the VST 3 SDK are
  checked out (no `base`, `vstgui4`, `tutorials`, `doc`). The ASIO SDK is a
  separate product (GPLv3 / proprietary) and is **not** used.
* "VST" is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH. The MIT license
  covers the SDK code; use of the VST logo/trademark is governed separately by
  Steinberg's usage guidelines (`VST3_Usage_Guidelines.pdf` in the SDK). We
  ship no logo.
* The test plugins in `engine/test_plugins/` are original code written for
  this project against the SDK interfaces; they are built into the build tree
  only and are not distributed.

## App: LAME (MP3 export)

The app (not the engine) links LAME for MP3 export, through the Rust crates
`mp3lame-encoder` 0.3.0 and `mp3lame-sys` 0.2.0 (crates.io), which compile
LAME's `libmp3lame` from the sources shipped in the `mp3lame-sys` crate
(`lame-4.0`) into the app binary. Used in `crates/dstudio-app/src/mp3.rs`.

| Component | Source | Version | License |
|---|---|---|---|
| LAME (`libmp3lame`) | https://lame.sourceforge.io/ via https://github.com/DoumanAsh/mp3lame-sys | as bundled in `mp3lame-sys` 0.2.0 | GNU Library (Lesser) General Public License, version 2 or later |
| `mp3lame-sys`, `mp3lame-encoder` (Rust bindings) | https://github.com/DoumanAsh/mp3lame-encoder | 0.2.0, 0.3.0 | LGPL-3.0 |

The LGPL asks that people receiving the app can relink it against a
modified LAME. Device's complete source (AGPL-3.0-or-later) is public, so a
modified LAME can be built into it with `cargo` (for example with a
`[patch.crates-io]` entry for `mp3lame-sys`). The license texts ship in the
crates (`COPYING` in `lame-4.0`, `LICENSE` in each crate).
