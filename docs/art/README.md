# README and social artwork

The banner, the close-ups, the architecture panel and the social preview at the top of the
[README](../../README.md) are HTML pages rendered to PNG. Edit a page here, then render:

```sh
npm install --no-save playwright && npx playwright install chromium   # once
node tools/art/render.mjs              # every page, into docs/assets/art/
node tools/art/render.mjs hero         # one page
```

| Page | Output | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `hero.html` | `hero.png` | top of the README |
| `feature-*.html` | `feature-*.png` | README › A closer look |
| `architecture.html` | `architecture.png` | README › Under the hood |
| `social-preview.html` | `social-preview.png` (1280×640) | Settings › General › Social preview, uploaded by hand |

`art.css` holds the shared look: colours from the app's `crates/dstudio-app/ui/tokens.slint` and the app's
bundled Inter font. `mark.svg` is the mark: one cycle of a sine wave on the app's blue.

## The app views

`shots/` holds the app views the pages frame. They show a whole song, "Night Drive", rather than a
test state: `tools/art/demo_song.py` writes it (six sections, six tracks and two returns, every sound
synthesised by the script, the same output every run), and the app's `--showcase <view>` option puts
the opened project into a view. The shots are rendered by the app itself at 2x, with the Linux menu bar
(the top 88 pixels) cropped off:

```sh
python3 tools/art/demo_song.py "/tmp/Night Drive"   # the app titles the project after the folder
SLINT_SCALE_FACTOR=2 SLINT_WGPU_CPU=1 WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 3200x2000x24" \
  target/release/device-studio --no-audio --zoom 85 --open "/tmp/Night Drive" --timeline-zoom 52 \
  --showcase arrange --screenshot /tmp/arrange.png --exit-after-frames 40
magick /tmp/arrange.png -gravity north -chop 0x88 docs/art/shots/arrange.png
```

| Cropped shot | `--showcase` |
|---|---|
| `docs/art/shots/arrange.png` | `arrange` (the whole song, the Lead's Synth below) |
| `docs/art/shots/analyzers.png` | `analyzers` (Pitch Corrector, Tuner and Spectrum on the vocal) |
| `docs/art/shots/lfo.png` | `lfo` (an LFO on the FX track's Auto Filter) |

The other views, `pianoroll`, `mixer`, `export` and `recording`, are the ones the website's tour uses.
`--zoom 85` makes the interface scale exactly 2, so the layout matches a 1440×820 window, and
`--timeline-zoom 52` fits the 36 bars. `--exit-after-frames 40` lets the start-up status messages
clear. When a view changes visibly, render its shot again, crop it into `docs/art/shots/` the same
way and re-run `render.mjs`.

## Fine Signal material

Public artwork uses `textures/fine-signal.png`, the approved fine blue dot treatment, behind
its headings and frames. `art.css` applies it more quietly to the information-heavy feature and
architecture panels. This is a marketing texture: the app screenshots in `shots/` are not edited,
and no desktop interface styles are changed. The original waveform mark is also unchanged.

The texture is a project-specific generated bitmap. Its exact generation prompt is in
`textures/fine-signal-prompt.txt`. Website AVIF/WebP variants are derived from this same source.
