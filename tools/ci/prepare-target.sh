# Prepares the cargo target dir restored from the CI cache for this job's build (CI only):
#
#   tools/ci/prepare-target.sh debug|release
#
# $CARGO_TARGET_DIR must be set. What it does, and why:
#
# 1. Keeps only this job's profile. The tests job builds debug, the app job release; a target
#    dir restored from the older shared cache holds both, and saving the other profile again
#    would only grow the cache.
#
# 2. Makes every tracked source newer than the restored build. Cargo (path crates, build
#    scripts' rerun-if-changed) and Ninja decide what to rebuild by modification time.
#    Checkout writes every file before the restore, so the sources are normally newer anyway,
#    but a main run that saves its cache between this job's checkout and its restore would
#    make its outputs look newer than the checkout, and cargo would reuse them for different
#    sources. Touching after the restore rules that out: every workspace crate and the
#    engine are always rebuilt from this commit's sources (C++ objects come back from ccache
#    when their preprocessed source, flags and compiler match).
#
# 3. Removes CMake caches that were made in another checkout folder (a renamed repository
#    moves the workspace), which CMake refuses to reuse. Not on Windows, whose paths CMake
#    spells differently from Git Bash.
#
# 4. Removes the engine build script's output (`cargo clean -p dstudio-engine`), so its CMake
#    build tree is configured from scratch. The rebuild itself does not depend on this (step 2
#    already reruns build.rs), but a restored CMakeCache.txt pins the compiler's full path,
#    which a runner image update (a new Xcode or MSVC version) removes, and keeps cache
#    variables that build.rs no longer passes. The fresh configure costs about 15 to 30
#    seconds; the compiles are ccache hits.
