//! Offline render of a project on a private engine, for jobs that run on a worker thread (the
//! clip menu's Consolidate, Bounce and Export audio, src/clip_render.rs in the app).
//!
//! The engine of the running app is never touched: the render makes its own [`Engine`] without
//! an audio device, loads the project's audio files into it, publishes the project and plays it
//! through [`Engine::render_offline`] in chunks.
//!
//! **Plugins (VST3, AU, CLAP).** They want their creation, state, latency and teardown on the
//! main thread (a CLAP plugin calls its creating thread its main thread, and
//! [`Engine::publish`] creates), while a render must not hold the main thread. So a render with
//! plugins is split in three:
//!
//! 1. [`Session::new`] and [`Session::prepare_next`] run on the main thread, one plugin per call (the app
//!    calls one per UI tick): each instance is created in the private engine with the current state of the
//!    live instance, so the render sounds like playback.
//! 2. [`Session::render`] runs anywhere (the worker): it publishes with the engine detached
//!    ([`Engine::set_plugin_detached`]: it reuses the prepared instances, creates, restarts and
//!    destroys nothing), renders the plugin delay compensation's latency L frames more than asked
//!    and drops the first L, so the file is aligned to the timeline like the audible playback.
//! 3. Dropping the [`Session`] destroys the instances; do it on the main thread.
//!
//! Plugins run in real-time process mode, like in playback: a plugin that sounds different when
//! it knows it is offline would make the file differ from what the user hears.
